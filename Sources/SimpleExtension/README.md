#  SimpleExtension

This simple extension shows how you can create a class that
is exposed to Godot and how you bootstrap it.

The code is contained in Demo.swift, the package definition
is contained by ../Package.swift and you must copy the 
resulting binary (SimpleExtnesion) into the bin directory 
of your Godot project and place the SwiftSprite.gdextension file
in the Godot project root.
